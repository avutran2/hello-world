Hello World!
My name is Andrew Tran.
The year is 2019 and I am currently an intern at 7-Eleven.
I have been working here for about 2 months now and I love it here.
Hopefully I can acquire a lot of knowledge here and maybe find a career here as well.
It is a wonderful place to work with wonderful people.
Ever since I started working here I can see myself growing up as an individual.
The team I have been working with have been extremely helpful and welcoming.
They encourage me to ask questions and make the most of the moment because this will come and go.
I have only a couple of weeks left and I want to learn as much as I can during my time here!
